The slides from today's session have been uploaded to our shared google drive. 
The aforementioned scripts are supposed to be used to complement the slides. 
The idea is that as you read through the slides, the queries are written to provide practical implementations to the concepts discussed in class. 
I would recommend that you tweak the scripts and further buttress your understanding.
